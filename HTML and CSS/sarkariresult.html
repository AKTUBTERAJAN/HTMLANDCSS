A PO role allows opportunities for career growth to middle and senior management based on performance and additional examinations.

        There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly competitive. The Times of India said it best when they said that the numbers are staggering:
        <br/> <br/>
        2.3 million applications for 368 peon positions in Uttar Pradesh.
        <br/>
        2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal
        <br/>
        200,000 applications for 1,137 positions as police constables in Maharashtra.
        <br/>
        When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000 positions, they received more than 19 million (1.9 crores) job applications.
        <br/>
        With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the drop in the number of people hired by the government. The central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost 32,000 jobs. There was a similar drop in 2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the state government. This creates an extremely competitive environment. Getting up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari Result and understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out from the crowd. These are of course some of the most coveted roles in India and are extremely competitive.
